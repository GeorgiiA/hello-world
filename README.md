This is a repository about my experience with GitHub.

Step 1. I created the branch, redme-edits, do some changes and commit them.

Step 2. I pulled request and had got a message about conflict. To resolve the conflict, I pressed the buttob 'Resolve conflicts', got the text with conflict markers (>>>>, =====, <<<<<), removed them and all that should not be in the revised verion of master document. Then pressed the button 'marked as resolved'.

Step 3. I pressed merge button to put all changes in master document and pressed the button 'delete branch' in the end.

Step 4. I did changes in 'readme' and commit them as the new branch. The I opened pull request. There were no conflicts this time. It seems to me that adding lines do not cause a conflict.
